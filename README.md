Collaboration
------------

1. Clone and enter into the repository  
```
git clone https://github.com/pawan47/box-office-knowledge-discovery.git
cd path/to/cloned-directory
```

2. Team members should make changes and test their code in their specific branch  
Each branch should be named as *user-initials* followed by *working-branch*  
Example: for initials *XYZabc* typing `git checkout -b xyzabc-working-branch` will create and checkout into the *xyzabc-working-branch*  
Omit the `-b` flag if the branch already exists  
Do not make a new branch for everytime some code is to be added or modified

3. Access and upload data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uMUfso4577TO1RnfVHzqAg2oTW6XtWaS?usp=sharing)  

Goals
-----

1. Prepare of a consolidated database of movie details (cast,
director, production house, description, critical analysis, wikipedia) by
web-scraping

2. Use features like popularity (followers on twitter etc) of the cast and
director & performance of their previous movies

3. Preparing a ML model to predict movie ratings and Box-office
performance of the movies based on these factors
